Based on the development instructions and the task to implement changes related to `public/logo.svg`, I will create a new file with a simple SVG logo for the OKR app. Here's the content for the new `public/logo.svg` file:

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="45" fill="#4A90E2" />
  <text x="50" y="60" font-family="Arial, sans-serif" font-size="24" fill="white" text-anchor="middle">OKR</text>
  <path d="M25 75 L50 25 L75 75" stroke="white" stroke-width="4" fill="none" />
</svg>
```

This SVG logo consists of:
1. A blue circle as the background
2. The text "OKR" in white at the center
3. A simple upward-pointing arrow shape to represent growth or achievement

This logo aligns with the app's purpose of tracking Objectives and Key Results, using a clean and modern design that fits with the requested improvements to the user interface.
